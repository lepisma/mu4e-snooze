#+TITLE: mu4e-snooze

Snooze feature for [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]]. Allows for day level granularity right now.

Another motivation for working on this project was to figure out capabilities of
GPT-4. For that, I tried co-programming with ChatGPT running on GPT-4. At some
point I stopped. Log of my interaction is kept in ~devlog.md~. A more detailed
review is going to come in my blog.
